# Deathnote DAO - buildspace x thirdweb - Build your own DAO with just Javascript

It is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization over the Rinkeby network of Ethereum blockchain. This platform uses membership NFTs to verify whether a user is a member of the DAO or not. The decision in the DAO are taken based upon a voting system where people are allowed to vote with the given threee choices (For, Against and Abstain) on a particualar proposal. The voting is also evaluated based upon the number of DAO tokens a person hold.

The best part about this project is that it is developed using Jasacript without the need of writing solidity smart contracts. It is written using thirdweb.
